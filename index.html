                        <p class="description">As a senior DevOps engineer, I have made significant contributions to major projects, collaborating with stakeholders to design AWS infrastructure for application deployments. I've led initiatives to enhance CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins, creating reusable build and deployment processes for new projects.</p>
                        <p class="description">My expertise extends to emerging technologies like Kubernetes, where I've conducted proof-of-concepts and driven implementation. I exclusively use Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code due to its technology-agnostic nature. In addition to technical work, I've mentored traditional operations engineers in their transition to DevOps roles and assisted in recruiting skilled engineers as a technical screener. My qualifications include AWS Solutions Architect, SysOps, and DevOps certifications. As a member of the security mavens team, I promote best practices for secure coding and infrastructure. I've also completed SANS 540 and 401 classes, obtaining the associated certifications to further strengthen my security knowledge.</p>
